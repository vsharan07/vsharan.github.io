### Crossfire
In January 2025 the team at Miami Community News noticed the work we were doing reviving the Debate team at our school and invited some of us on the board on their show. Impressed with our performance, they offered us the wonderful opportunity of hosting a show focusing on the youth in the community. I named the show Crossfire, after the segment of a Debate round where opponents ask questions to each other in an almost conversational manner. On the show, we interview young people doing unique things in the community, debate important issues for the youth of Miami, and more. A playlist of the episodes I have been in are linked below.

### QGIS
I have been a fan of geography since elementary school. Last year, I wanted to create something for it to really dive deeper in one of my favorite interests. As a result, in my spare time I have worked with QGIS mapping software to model geographic topics I find interesting. Linked are some posts of my GIS work on Reddit.

### SIP
To expand my robotics skills and learn about machine learning, I participated in a project last year in the Science Internship Program at UCSC. This project applied machine learning to visual servoing of a robotic arm. I learned kinematic techniques, control theory, and SIMULINK modeling and assisted the Hybrid Systems Lab at UCSC by designing the inverse kinematics system and setting up a robotic arm. A demo is linked below.

### AGU BrightSTaRs
Through the Stanford Design Your Energy Lifestyle Program, I wrote an abstract for the AGU BrightSTaRs conference. My topic was Investigating Spatial Relationships Between Electrical Power Plants Emissions, County-Level Air Pollution, and Demographics in the United States. A QGIS map of my data is pictured below.
